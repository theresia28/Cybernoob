# Incident Report: Cybersecurity Breach at YummyRecipesForMe.com

### 1. **Incident Overview**  
A former employee of YummyRecipesForMe.com executed a brute force attack to gain access to the website's web host. The hacker used known default passwords to gain access to the admin panel, embedded malware in the website's source code, and changed the administrative password. This attack led to several customers downloading and running malware after visiting the site.

### 2. **Malicious Activity Details**  
1. The former employee/hacker performed a brute force attack, trying multiple default passwords until they found the correct one.
2. Once logged into the admin panel, the hacker embedded a JavaScript function into the website’s source code that prompted visitors to download a file upon visiting the site.
3. The hacker then changed the administrative password, preventing the website owner from accessing the admin panel.

### 3. **Impact on Customers**  
Several customers reported that when they visited the website, they were prompted to download a file to access free recipes. After running the file, their browsers were redirected to a fake website, greatrecipesforme.com, and their personal computers started running slowly.

### 4. **Investigation and Analysis**  
1. **Sandbox Environment**  
   The cybersecurity team created a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior.

2. **Network Protocol Analysis**  
   The team used tcpdump, a network protocol analyzer, to monitor the website’s behavior. When the URL for the website was accessed, the following process occurred:
   - The browser initiated a DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com.
   - The DNS server responded with the correct IP address for the website.
   - The browser made an HTTP request to the server using the provided IP address.
   - The browser then initiated the download of a malicious executable file.
   - A DNS request was made for greatrecipesforme.com.
   - The DNS server responded with the IP address for the fake website.
   - The browser made an HTTP request to this new IP address, redirecting the user to the malicious website.

### 5. **Source Code Review and Malware Analysis**  
1. **Compromised Source Code**  
   A senior analyst examined the website’s source code and found JavaScript that prompted visitors to download the malware.
2. **Malware Behavior**  
   Analysis of the downloaded file revealed that it contained a script redirecting browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.

### 6. **Brute Force Attack Findings**  
The cybersecurity team discovered that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The attacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default one, and there were no security controls in place to prevent brute force attacks.

### 7. **Network Protocols Involved**  
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Used to resolve the domain name (yummyrecipesforme.com) into an IP address.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for the browser to request and receive the website and download the malicious file.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensured the reliable transmission of data during the communication between the browser and the server.

### 8. **Recommendation for Prevention**  
To prevent future brute force attacks, it is recommended to implement the following security actions:
1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that all admin accounts use strong, unique passwords.
2. **Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms**: Set up account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an additional layer of security to the admin login process.
4. **Regularly Update and Monitor Web Server Configurations**: Conduct regular audits to ensure that security best practices are being followed.

# Incident Report: Brute Force Attack and Malicious Download

### Section 1: **Identify the network protocol involved in the incident**
1. The protocol involved in the incident is the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**.
2. Since the issue was with accessing the web server for **yummyrecipesforme.com**, we know that requests to web servers for web pages involve HTTP.
3. When tcpdump was run and the **yummyrecipesforme.com** website was accessed, the corresponding tcpdump log showed the usage of the HTTP protocol when contacting the server.
4. Additionally, the malicious file was observed being transported to the users’ computers using the HTTP protocol at the application layer.

### Section 2: **Document the incident**
1. Several customers contacted the website’s helpdesk, stating that when they visited the website, they were prompted to download and run a file that promised access to new recipes. 
2. Customers reported that their personal computers had been operating slowly ever since running the file.
3. The website owner tried logging into the web server but noticed they were locked out of their account.
4. The cybersecurity analyst used a **sandbox environment** to safely open the website without impacting the company network.
5. The analyst ran tcpdump to capture the network traffic packets produced by interacting with the website.
6. The analyst was prompted to download a file claiming it would provide access to free recipes, accepted the download, and ran it.
7. After executing the file, the browser redirected the analyst to a fake website (**greatrecipesforme.com**).
8. The cybersecurity analyst inspected the tcpdump log and observed the following:
   - The browser initially requested the IP address for the **yummyrecipesforme.com** website.
   - Once the connection with the website was established over the **HTTP protocol**, the analyst recalled downloading and executing the file.
   - The logs showed a sudden change in network traffic as the browser requested a new IP address for the **greatrecipesforme.com** URL.
   - The network traffic was then rerouted to the new IP address for the **greatrecipesforme.com** website.
9. A senior cybersecurity professional analyzed the source code for the websites and the downloaded file. The analyst discovered that the attacker had manipulated the website’s code to prompt users to download a malicious file disguised as a browser update.
10. Since the website owner was locked out of their administrator account, the team believes the attacker used a **brute force attack** to gain access and change the admin password.
11. The execution of the malicious file compromised the end users’ computers.

### Section 3: **Recommend one or more remediations for brute force attacks**
1. **Disallow previous passwords**: One security measure the team plans to implement is to disallow previous passwords from being reused. Since the vulnerability that led to this attack was the attacker’s ability to use a default password, it is important to prevent old passwords, such as default passwords, from being reused during password resets.
2. **Require frequent password updates**: Another supportive measure is to require more frequent password updates. This ensures that if an unauthorized person becomes aware of the password, they are less likely to be able to use it if it is updated frequently.
3. **Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Finally, the team recommends implementing **two-factor authentication (2FA)**. 2FA requires users to authenticate via their password and confirm their identity with a one-time passcode (OTP) sent to their email or phone. Once the user confirms their identity through both the login credentials and the OTP, they gain access to the system. This method makes it more difficult for malicious actors attempting brute force attacks to gain access, as it requires additional authentication.

### Section 1: **Identify the network protocol involved in the incident**
1. The protocol involved in the incident is the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**.
2. Since the issue was related to accessing the web server for **yummyrecipesforme.com**, it is clear that requests to web servers for web pages typically involve HTTP.
3. The tcpdump log showed the usage of the HTTP protocol when contacting the server during interactions with the **yummyrecipesforme.com** website.
4. Additionally, the malicious file was observed being transported to the users’ computers over the HTTP protocol at the application layer.
5. The primary goal of this section was to identify the network protocol used in the incident. This was determined by reviewing the scenario, DNS & HTTP logs, and the knowledge of the TCP/IP model:
   - The tcpdump log shows a request being sent to the DNS server to resolve the IP address for **yummyrecipesforme.com**. The DNS server responds with the correct IP address, directing the user to the website.
   - The scenario specifies that the website prompts users to download a file to access free recipes. Both the scenario and the logs indicate that this action occurs over the HTTP protocol, which is part of the application layer of the TCP/IP model.
   - After the user downloads and runs the file, the logs show that the browser sends a new request to the DNS server to retrieve the IP address for the different URL, **greatrecipesforme.com**. The DNS server responds with the IP address, and the user is redirected to the new site over HTTP.
