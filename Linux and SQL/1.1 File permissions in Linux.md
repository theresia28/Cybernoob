# File Permissions in Linux

## **Project Description**
The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:

## **Tasks Performed**
### 1. **Check file and directory details**

The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.

The first line of the screenshot displays the command I entered, and the other lines display the output. The code lists all contents of the `projects` directory. 

I used the `ls` command with the `-la` option to:
- Display a detailed listing of the file contents.
- Include hidden files in the output.

### Output Analysis
The command output indicates:
- **1 directory**: `drafts`.
- **1 hidden file**: `.project_x.txt`.
- **5 other project files**.

The **10-character string** in the first column represents the permissions set on each file or directory.

## Describe the Permissions String

The **10-character permissions string** can be broken down as follows:

1. **1st character**:
   - Indicates the file type:
     - `d`: Directory.
     - `-`: Regular file.
2. **2nd-4th characters**:
   - Permissions for the **user**:
     - `r`: Read.
     - `w`: Write.
     - `x`: Execute.
     - `-`: Permission not granted.
3. **5th-7th characters**:
   - Permissions for the **group**:
     - `r`: Read.
     - `w`: Write.
     - `x`: Execute.
     - `-`: Permission not granted.
4. **8th-10th characters**:
   - Permissions for **other** (all other users):
     - `r`: Read.
     - `w`: Write.
     - `x`

# Change File Permissions on a Hidden File

The research team at my organization recently archived project_x.txt. They do not want anyone to have write access to this project, but the user and group should have read access. 

The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to change the permissions:
