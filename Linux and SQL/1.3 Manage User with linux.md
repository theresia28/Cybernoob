# **Project Description: User Access Management**

In this scenario, a new employee (**researcher9**) has just joined the organization. The research team tasked me with managing user access within the organization. 

Since the operating system is Linux, the tasks were executed using the **Linux Bash shell** via the Linux Terminal.

# Key Commands Overview

- **adduser**: Create a new user account.
- **passwd**: Assign or update the userâ€™s password.
- **usermod**: Modify user group memberships.
- **chmod**: Set directory/file permissions.
- **chown**: Change directory/file ownership.
- **su**: Switch to another user account to test access.


## **Tasks Performed**

1. **Add a New User and Group**
   
   A new employee has joined the Research department. In this task, you must add them to the system. The username assigned to them is researcher9.

Write a command to add a user called researcher9 to the system.
   I added a new user account for **researcher9** to the system using the following command:  
   ```bash
   sudo adduser researcher9
   ```
Next, I need to add the new user to the research_team group.

I use the usermod command and -g option to add researcher9 to the research_team group as their primary group.
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
   ```
You could alternatively use the following variation of useradd when creating the user to perform both steps at once:
   ```bash
sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team
   ```

2. **Assign file ownership**
   
The new employee, researcher9, will take responsibility for project_r. In this task, I'm make them the owner of the project_r.txt file.

The project_r.txt file is located in the /home/researcher2/projects directory, and owned by the researcher2 user.

I use the chown command to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt.

The command to complete this step:
```bash
sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
```

3. **Add the user to a secondary group**

A couple of months later, this employee's role at the organization has changed, and they are working in both the Research and the Sales departments.

In this task, I add researcher9 to a secondary group (sales_team). Their primary group is still research_team.

I use the usermod command with the -a and -G options to add researcher9 to the sales_team group as a secondary group.

The command to complete this step:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9
```

4. **Delete a user**

A year later, researcher9, decided to leave the company. In this task, I remove them from the system.

I run this command to delete researcher9 from the system:
```bash
sudo userdel researcher9
```
Run the following command to delete the researcher9 group that is no longer required:
```bash
sudo groupdel researcher9
```
