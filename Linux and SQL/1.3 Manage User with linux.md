# **Project Description: User Access Management**

In this scenario, a new employee (**researcher9**) has just joined the organization. The research team tasked me with managing user access within the organization. 

Since the operating system is Linux, the tasks were executed using the **Linux Bash shell** via the Linux Terminal.

## **Tasks Performed**

1. **Add a New User**  
   I added a new user account for **researcher9** to the system using the following command:  
   ```bash
   sudo adduser researcher9
   ```
